# gfg-catalog-services

## Points to Consider
- As this is non-production environment I preferred Basic authentication to invoke catalog API
- Use the following credentials to generate the token and pass to the Authorization Header
	Username: gfgcatalog
	Password: gfgcatalogpass
- Did not implement the versioning of API

## Deploy
Docker file has been created. Use this to create an image and then ** docker build <path> **. Path refers to the path containing docker file


## APIs
All the APIs are saved as a POSTMAN collection and the same JSON file has been committed to the repository.
